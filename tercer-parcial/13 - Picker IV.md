## Descripción
Can you figure out how this program works to get the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Connect to the program with netcat:`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62601`The program's source code can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/527/picker-IV.c). The binary can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/527/picker-IV).

## Pistas 
1. With Python, there are no binaries. With compiled languages like C, there is source code, and there are binaries. Binaries are created from source code, they are a conversion from the human-readable source code, to the highly efficient machine language, in this case: x86_64.
2. How can you find the address that `win` is at?
